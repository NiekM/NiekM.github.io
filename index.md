## [Program Synthesis Using Example Propagation](https://rdcu.be/c26m0)

We present [Scrybe]{.tool}, an example-based synthesis tool for a
statically-typed functional programming language, which combines topdown
deductive reasoning in the style of $λ^2$ with [Smyth]{.tool}-style live
bidirectional evaluation. During synthesis, example constraints are propagated
through sketches to prune and guide the search. This enables [Scrybe]{.tool} to
make more eﬀective use of functions provided in the context. To evaluate our
tool, it is run on the combined, largely disjoint, benchmarks of $λ^2$ and
[Myth]{.tool}. [Scrybe]{.tool} is able to synthesize most of the combined
benchmark tasks.
